## Welcome

to the BackCap-DEAMON repository, the **client** component of the [BackCap](https://github.com/Edems-DEV/BackCap) management system of backups. This project is divided into three parts: web, daemon, and server, which is the focus of this repository. Here you will find the source code for the BackCap client, which is built using C#. The client is in charge of requesting and getting the jobs from the server over REST API and then by the using requested job makes a backup with settings specified in the job config. Then POST the logs about failed or finished jobs to the server. But first, it needs to be whitelisted in the dashboard more about that [here](https://github.com/Edems-DEV/BackCap_WEB).

And don't forget to leave ⭐.
